# Market-project
I make online stores for several people and thought why not post one of my projects here. This is not a finished project, it will be completed within a month and will be published on the Internet, this is just a small but useful part of it. I think there is some easy and useful js code here that can help your websites.

# Site functionality
Many buttons work; At the end of the page, under the product slider, there is a “View All” button. You will be redirected to the product page where you will see a shopping cart in the top right corner. Actually, this is the whole point at the moment. It is shown how this cart works and the “Move to cart” button will open you a mobile window where there are also functions for deleting and adding goods. Submitting the form works too, but I won't upload that file here.

# Files
The files will be updated and a link to the site will be added later.
